This tool is mainly for writing [tellme.tokyo](https://github.com/b4b4r07/tellme.tokyo) blog. If you run this app with `edit `command, you can choise the exisiting articles with cool [prompt](https://github.com/manifoldco/promptui). Internally, this app makes hugo server run as background process. So it makes you easy to access localhost:1313 while writing your post without calling hugo server separately!
